                                                <p> This is a project which involved recreating the classic
                                                        snake game and adding a twist to it.
                                                        The twist involved adding an extra pick up. This pick up(pink)
                                                        allows the
                                                        snake to digest food it has already consumed to reduce its size.
                                                        The pick up last for a very short time so the player will have
                                                        to prioritize
                                                        it if the player wants the pick up.
                                                        This game also has a mode option to choose between a wrap around
                                                        world or boxed world.

                                                <p>I created this project to test my JavaFx skills after I finished a
                                                        course on Udemy. This project allows the user to draw objects
                                                        using either a pencil, line or rectangle using a limited amount
                                                        of colors. This program can also save and load files if needed.
                                                        One of the major challenges I had with this project was the
                                                        implementation of the pencil. The action listener wasn't
                                                        listening fast enough if the user moved the mouse at high speeds
                                                        so I had to implement an an algorithm to fill in the gaps as
                                                        needed. It wasn't perfect but it did get the job done.</p>

                                                <p>This project was created to test my skills to see if i could recreate
                                                        the classic Tetris game. The project was made using Java and the
                                                        interface was implemented using JavaFx. One of the major
                                                        challenges I faced during this project was how I would store the
                                                        tetris objects and how that would affect collision checking.</p>

                                                <p>This project was created during university. It involves creating a
